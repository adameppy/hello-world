Creative Portion:

-We caused the page to refresh every 10 seconds to make sure that soon after tweets were posted by another user, the current user could see the new tweet.
-We caused the mouse to be followed by a cursor. We made the cursor follow close enough so it would embellish the cursor on the user's computer, but not close enough to block the user from clicking anything on the site.
-We also include a small map showing the user's current location.



Notes about our project:
We have used the following tutorial code to start creating our application.
We had asked TAs earlier whether we could use certain code from online tutorials to start our app and they approved.

We used this tutorial to start our app:

We received the following mouse code from the website below:
